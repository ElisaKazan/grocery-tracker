A place to keep track of the prices of frequently purchased items in various stores. 

This app will be an easy way to check and add prices while shopping in a store and replace the clunky [Grocery Prices Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9SSwuWb5LHJs947pUUsGAb21SWVi45sX3M4b0h7Ig/edit#gid=288718558).

## Goals
